asymtotic analysis of algorithms:
--------------------------------
time complexities: different based on hardware

"Big O" (O) notation describes an upper bound on how fast an algorithm grows with respect to its input size, while "Little O" (o) notation signifies that a function grows strictly slower than another function as the input size approaches infinity; essentially, "Big O" says "at most as fast as" while "Little O" says "strictly faster than" when comparing growth rates

theoretical analysis:- ram model:
--------------------------------
RAM: Random Access Machine
     potentially unbound bank of memory cells
     sequential model of computing, not parallel computing
Counter: Points to curently executing instruction

input tape: only readable

output tape: writable

      Input tape

          V
     Output tape

CU: figures out which instruction is being executed

CU, ALU, memory
Reg

PRAM: Parallel Random Access Machine

primitive: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, CMP
           int a = 5;
computer-based:
int max(int a, int b) {
  int max;
  if (a > b) // basic operation: comparing - A
    max = a; // basic operation: assignment - B
  else
    max = b; // basic operation: assignment - C
  return max; // basic operation - D
}

best case: (a > b)
           3 basic operations are carried out - A, B, D

worst case: !(a > b)
            still, 3 basic operations are carried out - A, C, D

average case: check i/p distribution

constant time complexity - O(1) - does not depend on the values of a and b

asymtotic notation for complexity analysis:
------------------------------------------
for y = 1/x
curve from +infinity on y axis in first quadrant to +infinity on x axis in first quadrant
curve from -infinity on x axis in third quadrant to -infinity on y axis in third quadrant

tight and non-tight upper bound - To see later
