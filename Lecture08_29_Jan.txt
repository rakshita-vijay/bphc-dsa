not all linearly recursive functions are tail recursion
tail recursion: final action of a function is a recursive call

algorithm, program, pseudocode, flowchart

algorithm complexity:
binary search, linear search

ex:
1) tower of hanoi: (2^n - 1)
2) travelling salesman (greedy heuristics): n^2
3) light switch: 1
4) fiding a person in a queue: n (asking people one by one if they are Mr. X)


to look for a word in an alphabetically sorted dictionary, how many algorithms are there? which one would you prefer?
linear search, binary search, fibonacci, hashmap, interpolation,
