Growth rate of algorithm:
------------------------
Problem - very steep curve if it is not log graph 
Pavlov law: y = k.n^p

Growth rate: rate at which a graph grows in order to accommodate a very large range 

Best complexity: linear or constant 
Example of cubic complexity: matrix multiplication 

BREAK ~~~~~~

Best case: 1.5L in 2 months 

Worst case: 2L in 2 months 

Average case: 2.5L in 2 months 

Example: 
Linear searching of a person is a queue:-
Best case: person in front of you
1 comparison
O(1)

Worst case: person farthest away from you
n comparisons 
O(n)

Average case: middle guy
Why hardest/most irritating case:
You need to have distribution of every month 
Why important: need to check how much computing power is required
